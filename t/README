Testing this module automatically is rather hard and a lot of data not supplied
by this module is necessary for it. Therefore, this module only comes with a
very basic test that needs to be run manually.
 
To do that, you will need to register an application on
http://www.strava.com/developers/ and retrieve your application id and secret.
 
In addition, you will need to create an account at http://www.strava.com/ to
authenticate with.
 
Once you have that, spin up the test application included in this distribution
using:
 
  $ cd t
  $ STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=foo STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=bar plackup -I../lib -Ilib testapp.psgi
 
Then point your browser at http://localhost:5000/auth
 
You should be redirected to a site at Facebook, asking you to confirm. Once
you've done that, you should be redirected back to http://localhost:5000/auth
and see 'success'.
